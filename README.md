# Frontend Mentor - Pomodoro app solution

This is a solution to the [Pomodoro app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pomodoro-app-KBFnycJ6G).

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Set a pomodoro timer and short & long break timers
- Customize how long each timer runs for
- See a circular progress bar that updates every minute and represents how far through their timer they are
- Customize the appearance of the app with the ability to set preferences for colors and fonts
